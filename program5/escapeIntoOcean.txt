  |********************************************|  
    NAME throws the box to the side and
    hops into the ocean. This was an easy task
    as NAME took swimming lessons as a
    child with their friend PARTNER.
    
    Unfortunately, thinking about this reminded
    NAME that they had forgotten to buy a
    present for PARTNER for their AGE birthday.
    
    NAME would never be able to do so, however,
    as they live the rest of their life as a
    new identity afraid of the box's
    consequences. They're safe, yet they
    regret having ever gotten involved with
    the box.
