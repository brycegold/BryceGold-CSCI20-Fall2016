    NAME makes it to the carriage house.
    
    "My, my, what have we here? You're such a
    young kid. How old are you?" says the
    driver.
    
    NAME answers with AGE.
    
    "Well, how nice. As long as you've got the
    money, I'll take you anywhere you need
    to go."
    
    NAME rides the carriage as far as it can 
    take them. As NAME goes along they sell 
    some treasure here and there. They have a 
    good time travelling. 
    
    NAME does, however, feel like they are 
    being watched no matter where they go. 
    NAME lives the rest of their life on edge.
